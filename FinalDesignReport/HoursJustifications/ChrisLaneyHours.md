## Justification of Activities
My main efforts for the project were architecting the front end solution and connectivity along with Seamus Collins as well as building out a large part of the spotify parser with Justin Tische along with hosting the site. Non technical efforts included the assignments with my team, coming up with a pivot when we ran into a big challange and creating documentation for code base
