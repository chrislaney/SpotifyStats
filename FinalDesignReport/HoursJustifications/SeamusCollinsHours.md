## Justification of Activities

My contributions to the SpotifyStats project were primarily focused on AWS infrastructure integration and front-end design enhancements. The fall semester was largely dedicated to planning, research, and documentation activities. I researched appropriate web frameworks for our project, participated in project planning sessions, and documented initial design decisions. I also began researching AWS DynamoDB capabilities in preparation for implementation in the spring semester.

The majority of my development contributions occurred during the spring semester, where I focused on implementing the AWS DynamoDB integration and enhancing the front-end functionality. I worked on creating the database handler class for storing and retrieving user data, implementing the User Comparison Front End, and developing the Playlist Generation Front End. These components were crucial for the core features of our application. I also contributed to AWS optimization, security upgrades, and overall performance improvements. Throughout both semesters, I participated in team meetings, contributing to design decisions, problem-solving discussions, and coordination efforts. Our regular Discord meetings and project repository document the development milestones throughout the academic year.
