**Project Abstract:**  
#### REVISE ME?
We are building a webapp that uses the Spotify API to pull users data, and extrapolate information about their listening history either directly or indirectly from the data given. This will be parsed by a backend system and then distributed to the frontend and also another backend component will utilize learning techniques in order to provide new music recommendations for the user. In essence there will be two visible portions to the project; the historical analysis interface and future prediction interface, all brought together by a backend parser/controller.â€‹

## User Stories and Design Diagrams

### User Stories
#### REVISE ME?
As an individual SpotifyStats user, I would like to get new music recommendations based on my current/past listening habits so that I can enjoy more new music.

As a SpotifyStats user, I would like the UI to be in the 80s retro style, because it's visually pleasing.

As a system, I would like to report errors from any third-party API calls, so that software developers can debug any user problems.

As a SpotifyStats developer I would like to be able to access Spotify data that is already cleaned with a straightforward method of retrieval so that it can be used in many parts of the application.
