## Co-op Work Experience

### Software Engineer
**Wicked Sheets, Louisville, KY (June 2024 - February 2025)**  
At Wicked Sheets, a SMART sheet manufacturing company developing blankets for nursing home patients to detect when assistance is needed, I built and maintained an HTTP API using REST techniques hosted on AWS servers. This work focused on protecting and securing client data while establishing weekly reporting systems for executive users. I also authored comprehensive documentation for the REST API, Zoho Analytics, and a custom database covering access, modifications, and support procedures.

### Associate Software Developer Co-Op
**CSC Corptax, Buffalo Grove, IL (September 2023 - December 2023)**  
During this co-op rotation, I developed an API-based Holiday Dates project that reduced a 160-hour manual task by 75%. I identified and presented opportunities for product improvements to enhance customer satisfaction and produced detailed technical documentation to facilitate seamless knowledge transfer.

### Software Developer Co-Op
**CSC Corptax, Buffalo Grove, IL (January 2023 - April 2023)**  
I created a C# program to consolidate text files into XML-formatted files, maintained multiple codebases through git and Azure, and implemented log reports across eight C# projects to improve debugging and monitoring capabilities.

### Junior Developer
**CADTALK, Fort Wright, KY (August 2021 - August 2022)**  
At CADTALK, a software company that automates the integration of engineering data into ERP applications, I designed and delivered a new product using C# that integrated REST APIs for OData processing. I debugged critical issues, added innovative features, and mentored new co-op employees by assigning, guiding, and reviewing their work.
