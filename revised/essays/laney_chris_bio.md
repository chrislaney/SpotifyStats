# Capstone Interest

My interest in a capstone project is pretty broad and flexible as I am more interested in the tenets of project development than any particular topic. Though I suppose I would be most interested in a project that uses a general programming language, python, c#, java.

As far as project topic - I am getting a minor in economics and have an interest in data science / data visualization. I think jupyter notebook is cool. I have an interest in anything music related, or sociological topics as well. As well as a general interest in Enterprise Resource Planning tech (SAP) especially in regard to agriculture and commodity sector 

Some projects I have considered would be 
- dating app that uses spotify api to match people
- fun data visualisation that hooks up to spotify api
- something that uses satallite photos of farms to predict yield growth?
- ERP systems are pretty interesting to me as well, so maybe something relating to that.
