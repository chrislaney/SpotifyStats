As an individual SpotifyStats user, I would like to get new music recommendations based on my current/past listening habits so that I can enjoy more new music. 

As a SpotifyStats user, I would like the UI to be in the 80s retro style, because it's visually pleasing.

As a system, I would like to report errors from any third-party API calls, so that software developers can debug any user problems.

As a SpotifyStats developer I would like to be able to access Spotify data that is already cleaned with a straightforward method of retrieval so that it can be used in many parts of the application.
