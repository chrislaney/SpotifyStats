## Project Topic Area

Our topic area is a spotify analytics web app. There are 2 components to the project, a portion that breaks down current listening history and habits and a portion that uses listening history with other deduction strategies to reccomend music to the user. This will all be tied up in a very aesthetic UI/UX.
